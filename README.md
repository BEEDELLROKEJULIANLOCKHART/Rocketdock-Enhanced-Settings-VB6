# Rocketdock-Enhanced-Settings-VB6
This utility is a functional reproduction of Rocketdock's original settings screen. This makes the utility familiar to Rocketdock users. The original Rocketdock's settings screen has a few annoying bugs or limitations. One of the bugs is the time that the extended Rocketdock requires to respond to a right-click on an icon when its icon library is large (300+ icons). This is vital functionality because it is precisely how the appearance or the functionality of any Rocketdock icon can be modified. This utility is open source VB6, enhances rocketdock, and fixes bugs.

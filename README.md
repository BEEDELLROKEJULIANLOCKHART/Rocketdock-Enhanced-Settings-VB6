# Rocketdock-Enhanced-Settings-VB6
This utility is a functional reproduction of Rocketdock's original settings screen. This makes the utility familiar to Rocketdock users. The original Rocketdock's settings screen has a few annoying bugs or limitations. One of the bugs is the time the extended time Rocketdock takes to respond to a right-click on an icon when your icon library is large (300+ icons) . This is vital functionality as it is precisely how you change the appearance or the functionality of any Rocketdock icon. This utility is open source VB6, enhances rocketdock and fixes bugs.
